# Game Console Inventory

This is the front end of my game console inventory app. Designed for video game console enthusiasts to log the consoles they own. It was written with React, TypeScript, and Material UI. It connects to the back end API which was created with Flask and PostgreSQL.

[Back end app](https://console-inventory.herokuapp.com/). Create an account here first, log in, and click 'Profile' to view your personal token.

[Front end app](https://console-inventory.web.app/). Log in with Google auth. As of now, only my personal token for the back end API is being used, so you will see consoles myself or others have added. But feel free to add, update, delete consoles on the Dashboard. Will fix it so it uses your personal token in the future.
